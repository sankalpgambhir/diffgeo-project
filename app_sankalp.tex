        \begin{column}{0.7\textwidth}
            Given that the space \(\topx\) is metrizable, assume a suitable
            metric candidate \(d: \topx \times \topx \to \reals\). We show that
            \(\topx\) is a Hausdorff space.

            For each pair \(x_i, x_j \in \topx \times \topx\), construct open
            balls \(B_{r_i}(x_i), B_{r_j}(x_j)\) centered at the respective
            points as induced the `metric' \(d\) such that \(r_i + r_j <
            \metric{x_i}{x_j}\). These are open sets, as \(d\), by premise,
            induces the topology on \(\topx\).

            We claim that these two open sets have empty intersection, i.e.,
            \(B_{r_i}(x_i) \cap B_{r_j}(x_j) = \emptyset\). If possible, suppose
            not, and we show that it leads to a contradiction. 
        \end{column}
    \end{columns}

\begin{frame}    
    By assumption, \(\exists x \in \topx, x \in B_{r_i}(x_i) \cap
    B_{r_j}(x_j)\). Then, since \(d\) is a well-defined metric candidate by
    premise, it must satisfy the triangle inequality

    \begin{equation*}
        \metric{x_i}{x_j} \leq \metric{x_i}{x} + \metric{x}{x_j}~.
    \end{equation*}

    We also have \(\metric{x_i}{x} < r_i\) and \(\metric{x}{x_j} <
    r_j\). So we get using the condition on the radii,
    \begin{gather*}
        \metric{x_i}{x_j} \leq \metric{x_i}{x} + \metric{x}{x_j} < \metric{x_i}{x_j}~,\\
        \metric{x_i}{x_j} < \metric{x_i}{x_j}~.
    \end{gather*}

    We have a contradiction and the claim is proved. Thus, there exist
    neighbourhoods for any pair of points in \(\topx\) such that they have
    separated neighbourhoods, and so \(\topx\) is a Hausdorff space.

    \underline{Note: this does not use the finiteness property.}

        \begin{column}{0.7\textwidth}
            Given, the space \(\topx\) is a \emph{finite} Hausdorff space. We
            show that \(\topx\) has the discrete topology.

            Consider a point \(x_i \in \topx\). We know by the Hausdorff
            property that for any other point \(x_j \in \topx\) distinct from
            \(x_i\) there exists a pair of neighbourhoods \((T_{ij}, T_{ji})\),
            i.e., open sets containing, of \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) which have empty
            intersection, i.e. \(T_{ij} \cap T_{ji} = \emptyset\).
        \end{column}
    \end{columns}   

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

    In particular, for a fixed index \(i\), note that 
    \begin{gather*}
        x_i \in \bigcap_{j\not = i} T_{ij}~, \text{ and}\\ 
        \forall k \not = i, x_k \not \in \bigcap_{j\not = i} T_{ij}~.
    \end{gather*}

    as for atleast one set in the intersection, each \(x_j\) is excluded
    from the intersection, except for \(x_i\), the `center' of the
    neighbourhoods. Since this is a finite intersection of open sets,
    due to the number of points in \(\topx\) being finite, \(\{x_i\}\)
    must be an open set for each \(i\), which by definition is the
    discrete topology.

    \frametitle{Counterexample for finiteness breaking the neighbourhood exclusion}

    I promised a counterexample for finiteness breaking the neighbourhood
    exlusion. Since we explicitly used it in the proof in the slides before
    this, that proof surely breaks. But the implication itself also fails.

    As discussed in the presentation roughly, consider the real line with the
    usual topology. This is well known to be both Hausdorff and metrizable with
    the Euclidean metric. Consider the singleton set \(\{0\}\). Since the space
    is metrizable, this set is open iff it can be generated by the candidate
    metric which induces the topology, i.e. for \(\{0\}\) to be open, we must have

    \begin{gather*}
        \forall y \in \{0\}, \exists \epsilon \text{ such that } B_\epsilon(y) \subseteq \{0\}~.
    \end{gather*}

    However, this is clearly not the case, as any open ball (interval) centered
    at 0 on the real line contains points other than 0 (due to the denseness
    property, to be precise).
